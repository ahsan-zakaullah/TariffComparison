                          Product Tariff Comparison
This project use to calculate the costs of different products.
  _Summary_
I am following service oriented approach and defining the seperate layer for models, repositories and services. I also written some test cases using XUnit

                           _Instructions_
Clone the repository.

open visual studio 2202 as administrator.

Note: Using .NET 6 for this project.

Build the solution and then run it!

Swagger integrated so you can view the endpoint.

You can just give the consumption as a paramter and will get the calculated tariff for the products.

Tarrif will be sorted by ascending order based on the cost.

You can also run the integration and unit tests to verify the endpoints.

#Happy_Coding. :)
